Recruiting is sales. You're selling your company, role, and opportunity to candidates who have multiple options and competing offers.

The recruiters and hiring managers who understand this - and apply proven sales methodologies - attract better candidates, close more offers, and build stronger teams.

Here's how to use each major sales methodology to supercharge your recruiting efforts.

## Why Sales Methodologies Matter for Recruiting

**The Reality**: Top talent has options. In competitive markets, the best candidates evaluate 3-5 opportunities before making a decision.

**The Advantage**: While other companies just "post jobs and hope," you'll have a systematic approach that:
- Attracts higher-quality candidates
- Builds stronger relationships with prospects
- Uncovers what candidates really want
- Positions your opportunity as the best choice
- Closes more offers with better acceptance rates

## Methodology Selection by Recruiting Stage
