Knowing a sales methodology and successfully implementing it are two different things. Most professionals fail not because they choose the wrong methodology, but because they implement it poorly.

This roadmap provides a systematic approach to implementing any sales methodology successfully, whether you're switching from traditional selling or upgrading from one methodology to another.

## The Implementation Reality Check

### Why Most Implementations Fail

- Inadequate support and coaching

### The Success Factors

**What Successful Implementations Have**:
- Clear implementation plan with milestones
- Systematic skill development process
- Regular practice and reinforcement
- Measurement and feedback systems
