Understanding human psychology is the ultimate competitive advantage in any persuasion situation. This interactive framework reveals the mental models that drive decision-making and shows you exactly how to influence them.

Whether you're selling products, raising capital, interviewing for jobs, or getting internal buy-in, these psychological principles remain constant.

## The Three-Layer Psychology Model

### Layer 1: The Survival Brain (Fight, Flight, Freeze)
**Function**: Threat detection and basic survival
**Response Time**: 11-400 milliseconds
**Influence on Decisions**: 60-80% of initial reactions

### Layer 2: The Emotional Brain (Feelings and Motivation)
**Function**: Emotion processing and motivation
**Response Time**: 400-800 milliseconds
**Influence on Decisions**: 70-90% of final decisions

### Layer 3: The Rational Brain (Logic and Analysis)
**Function**: Logical analysis and justification
**Response Time**: 800+ milliseconds
**Influence on Decisions**: 10-30% of decisions, 100% of justifications

**The Key Insight**: People make decisions with Layer 2 (emotion) and justify them with Layer 3 (logic). Layer 1 (survival) determines whether they'll even listen to you.
