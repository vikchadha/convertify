Consultative Selling is the antithesis of traditional sales. Instead of pushing products, you become a trusted advisor who helps customers make informed decisions - even if that means recommending a competitor or suggesting they do nothing.

The counterintuitive truth: **The less you sell, the more you sell.**

## What Is Consultative Selling?

Consultative Selling is a relationship-based sales methodology that prioritizes understanding the customer's business, building trust, and providing value beyond your product or service.

**Core Philosophy**: Be a business consultant first, salesperson second.
