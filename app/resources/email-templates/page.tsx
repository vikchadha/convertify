I'm assuming one of three things:
1. This isn't a priority right now

3. You've been eaten by an alligator

If it's #3, please let me know and I'll send help. ðŸ˜Š

Otherwise, should I close your file and check back in 6 months?

I know you mentioned [specific concern/objection]. They had the same concern, but found that [how it was addressed].

I completely understand the budget concerns. In fact, [Similar Company] said the exact same thing.

Here's what they discovered: they were already spending [amount] on [current inefficient solution/problem cost]. Our solution actually saved them money from day one.

I put together a quick ROI calculation based on your numbers:
â€¢ Current cost of [problem]: $[amount]/month
â€¢ Our investment: $[amount]/month
â€¢ Net savings: $[amount]/month
â€¢ Plus: [additional non-monetary benefits]

I wanted to make sure you saw that our [specific offer] expires this Friday.

After that, the investment goes from $[amount] to $[higher amount] - a difference of $[savings].

[Similar Company] just locked in this rate and they're projected to see [specific ROI] within [timeframe].

Can we hop on a quick call today or tomorrow to get you the same advantage?
